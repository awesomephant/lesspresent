#Less Presentation Framework

Less is a framework that helps you create awesome html presentations but doesn't get in your way.
It comes **without any default styles** or transitions or whatever. Just the Basics.

> Less is more, as some dead white dude used to say.
 
##Based on 35 lines of SASS and 19 lines of Javascript.
No seriously. One mixin and two rules / Two variables and two functions the latter.
